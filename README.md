# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis is to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louis, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play - Fever. By using Excel, we analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors to make a project's campaign successful. We take a look at the crowdfunding outcomes based on launch date as well as the outcomes based on the goals set for the campaigns. These insights are used to help Louis gain a greater understanding of campaigns so that she can mirror other succcessful campaigns in her category. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line chart above illustrates the outcomes of campaigns in the theater category versus the date they launched using months of the year. Based on the chart, we can see that May was the most successful month to launch. You can also see that Decemeber had the lowest success rate. Although May also has the greatest number of failures, we want to take into account that the total amount of theaters that launched during that month which was also the highest at 166. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line chart above illustrates the outcomes of campaigns versus the monetary goals they set to fund their campaigns. Based on the chart, we can see that campaigns with goals less tan $5000 had higher success rates with campaigns with goals less than $1000 having 76% success and campaigns with goals between $1000 and $4999 having 73% success. You can also see that campaigns with higher goals above $45,000 had higher rate of failure with campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 having 100% failure and campaigns with goals greater than $50,000 with 88% failure.

You'll also notice that goals set between $35,000 - $44,999 had a relatively high success rate at 67%. Although the sample size within these groups are small, this could indicate that there are other important factors other than fundraising goals that play a part in successful campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It is challenging to pin point the exact formula to a successful camaign. For example, in the line chart of Outcomes Based on Goals it is clear that goals less than $5000 had higher success rates and those with goals above $45,000 had lower success rates. However, goals set between $35,000 - $44,999 had relatively high success rates. It's difficult to conclude why this group still held a high success rate without more information given. Some of the successful campaigns had a relatively small amount of backers while others had many. They also launched during different parts of the year. Perhaps the playwrights of these plays were well-known so networking/fundraising came easier. We know that fundraising goals play a part into a campaigns success, but there are other factors that contribute as well. 

## Results

### Conclusions made about the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Campaigns launched in May had the highest number of successful campaigns
- Campaigns launched in December had the lowest number of successful campaigns

### Conclusions made about the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Fundraising goals of less than $5000 had the highest success rates

### Summary

As explained in the challenges and difficulties section, there are some limitations of this data set.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Another table/graph we could create could be
